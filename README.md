<h1>Question 1 (SQL Queries)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [85 points]</h1>
We are given a geostatistical database about countries, continents, rivers, etc. The following information is available in Canvas together with data for download:

<ul>
<li>An ER diagram of the geostatistical database in PDF format (<em>HW3Ex1- geostatistical-database-ERdiagram.pdf</em>).</li>
<li>An informal description of the database schema in PDF format (<em>HW3Ex1- geostatistical-databaseschema-explanation.pdf</em>).</li>
<li>A text file that contains create table commands to create the database schema (<em>HW3Ex1-geostatisticaldatabase-schema.sql</em>).</li>
<li>A text file hat contains insert commands for about 47,800 tuples to fill the database tables (<em>HW3Ex1geostatistical-database-input-data.sql</em>).</li>
<li>A text file that contains drop table commands to delete the database schema and the data in the database (<em>HW3Ex1-geostatistical-database-drop-tables.sql</em>).</li>
</ul>
Use the CISE Oracle DBMS and the Oracle SQL Developer software to create the database schema and fill the database with data. This will also help you learn about the system environment for your group project. In particular, the use of MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other database systems is not allowed.

(a) [10 points] Look at the database schema in the file <em>HW3Ex1-geostatistical-database- schema.sql</em>. You will find the following SQL statements from line 38 to line 52:

ALTER TABLE Country

ADD CONSTRAINT FK_CountryREFCity

FOREIGN KEY (Code, Capital, Province)

REFERENCES City(Country, Name, Province)

INITIALLY DEFERRED DEFERRABLE;

ALTER TABLE City

ADD CONSTRAINT FK_CityREFProvince

FOREIGN KEY (Country, Province)

REFERENCES Province(Country, Name)

INITIALLY DEFERRED DEFERRABLE;

ALTER TABLE Province

ADD CONSTRAINT FK_ProvinceREFCountry

FOREIGN KEY (Country)

REFERENCES Country(Code)

INITIALLY DEFERRED DEFERRABLE;

ALTER TABLE Province

ADD CONSTRAINT FK_ProvinceREFCity

FOREIGN KEY (Capital, Country, CapProv)

REFERENCES City(Name, Country, Province)

INITIALLY DEFERRED DEFERRABLE;

Your task is to explore this scenario by using the Internet. The keywords INITIALLY DEFERRED DEFERRABLE are non-standard SQL. They are supported by several database systems such as Oracle and PostgreSQL.

Answer the following questions.

<ul>
<li>[4 points] What is the meaning of these keywords?</li>
<li>[6 points] Why is the action indicated by the keyword INITIALLY DEFERRED DEFERRABLE needed in the scenario above? What is the problem? How is the problem solved?</li>
</ul>
(b) [75 points] Write SQL queries for the colloquial queries below and show the results by providing screenshots for both your SQL queries and query results. The screenshots must be embedded into the PDF file that contains your solutions to this whole assignment. In order to increase readability, the SQL queries should be written in a structured manner, all SQL keywords should be fully capitalized, and the table and attribute names should be written in the same way as in the schema file.

If not explicitly forbidden, the use of the Oracle specific ‚Äúrow limiting functions‚Äù such as the ‚ÄúFETCH‚Äù clause and the ‚ÄúROWNUM‚Äù function is allowed. The following two examples illustrate their use:

SELECT &lt;column_name(s)&gt;

FROM &lt;table_name&gt;

ORDER BY &lt;column_name(s)&gt;

FETCH FIRST &lt;number_of_rows&gt; ROWS ONLY;

SELECT &lt;column_name(s)&gt;

FROM &lt;table_name&gt;

ORDER BY &lt;column_name(s)&gt;

WHERE ROWNUM &lt;= &lt;number_of_rows&gt;;

Write SQL queries for the following questions and provide screenshots as described above.
